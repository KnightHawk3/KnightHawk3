I have started using PGP (My setup is GPG over commandline.) I now sign all my emails and occasionaly encrypt them.
```
GPG Key ID: 0xC2533566
GPG Fingerprint: 79B6 F781 6854 15B6 153B  88CE 68E1 7E92 C253 3566
```
<!-- more -->
If you want to quicky receive my keys this should work:
``` bash
gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-key 0xC2533566
```
