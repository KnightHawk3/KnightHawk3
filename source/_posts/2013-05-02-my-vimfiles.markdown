I put a good amount of work into my Vim configuration, here is some documentation and a rundown for it.

```vimL
"""""
" KnightHawk3's vimrc Knight Hawk3 (KnightHawk3.com)

"""
" Pathogen *cough cough*
call pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles()
call pathogen#helptags()
```

So this will open all the plugins in $VIMHOME/bundle/ and use them, this saves your vimfiles from being a convoluted mess, it then appends the help files, since I always forget to run helptags manually.


```vimL
"""
" Nerdtree
map <C-n> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
autocmd bufenter * if (winnr("$") == 1 && exists("b:NERDTreeType") && b:NERDTreeType == "primary") | q | endif " Close if its the last one
```

The first is a mapping that allows me to press ```ctrl-n``` to open a NERDTree menu, it also closes it if it is open, the next line closes Vim if NERDTree is the last window open.

```vimL
"""
" Filetypes
filetype on
filetype plugin indent on
```

This enables automatic filetype detection, pretty standard

```vimL
"""
" Autocompletion
au FileType python set omnifunc=pythoncomplete#Complete
let g:SuperTabDefaultCompletionType = "context"
set completeopt=menuone,longest,preview
```

These are some autocompletion options, allowing me to use tab complete in python and pretty much everything.

```vimL
"""
" Settings
set nocompatible " Oh my god yes.
set scrolloff=5  " Basically, doesn't let your cursor get to the top of the screen
set number	 " Line numbers
```

Sets nocompatible, you should have that already. Then my scrolloff, so that if my cursor is 5 lines from the top or bottom the window will start scrolling, this stops me from going to the bottom line. Finally it turns on line numbers

```vimL
" Seaching settings
set ignorecase	 " Ignores case in searching
set showmatch	 " Highlight matches
" Indentation settings
set tabstop=4    " 4 ts master race
set shiftwidth=4 " For the love of god.
set backspace=2  " Real backspacing
set expandtab    " Tabs become spaces
" Prettyness
set showcmd	     " Just so I can see
set laststatus=2 " For Powerline
```

Some settings that set various things, should be rather self explanatory.

```vimL
"""
" Mappings
"
let mapleader = ","

" \mdhtml converts document to html5
nmap <leader>mdhtml :%!pandoc -f markdown -t html5<cr>
" \mddtex converts to latex
nmap <leader>mdtex :%!pandoc -f markdown -t latex --template=default.latex<cr>

" \v opens my vimrc for editing
map <leader>v :tabe ~/vimfiles/.vimrc<cr>

map <leader>fb :FufBuffer
map <leader>ff :FufFile
```

This sets my mapleader to ```,``` so that I can have various bindings.

I then go on to set some cool bindings such as:

* ```,mdhtml``` this converts the current document from markdown to html5, using pandoc, pandoc must be installed.
* ```,mdtex``` this converts the current document from markdown to tex, using pandoc again.
* ```,v```  this opens my ```~/vimfiles/.vimrc``` for editing, TODO: change this to be dynamic.
* There are then some bindings for Fuzzy finder


```vimL
" Tagbar on ,tb
nmap <leader>tb :TagbarToggle<CR>
```

This toggles tagbar on ```,tb```

```vimL
" Tasklist on \td
map <leader>td <Plug>TaskList
" Hitting & on a word allows me to substitute that word in the current
" paragraph with the smallest number of keypresses I could come up with.
" Basically it puts the first part of a s/word/letter on the commmand line
" waiting for me to type the replacement and hit <CR>
nnoremap & :'{,'}s/<c-r>=expand('<cword>')<cr>/
```

This allows me to subsitute the word in a paragraph easily

```vimL
" jk leaves insert mode
inoremap jk <ESC>
```

I got sick of reaching for the escape key

```vimL
" Tasklist
map <leader>td <Plug>TaskList
```

This scans the page for TODO and shows me them, quite nice; bound to ```,td```

```vimL
" Window movement
map <c-j> <c-w>j
map <c-k> <c-w>k
map <c-l> <c-w>l
map <c-h> <c-w>h
```

Some nice window movement, saves me one keystroke.

```vimL
"""
" GUI stuff

"My font for the GUI, removing of some buttons, and UTF-8
set encoding=utf-8
set guifont=Consolas\ for\ Powerline\ FixedD:h12
set guioptions=egmrt
```

Sets my font to Consolas for powerline, encoding to UTF-8 and turns off some of the upper buttons

```vimL
" Theme
set background=light
let g:solarized_termtrans=1
let g:solarized_termcolors=256
let g:solarized_contrast="high"
let g:solarized_visibility="high"
syntax on
colorscheme solarized
```

Sets my background to light, makes my terminal transparent, turns up readability, turns on syntax highlighting, and enables solarized!


Thats all, you can find the vimfiles and my plugins in my [git repository on github](https://github.com/KnightHawk3/vimfiles).
